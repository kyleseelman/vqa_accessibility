## Align before Fuse: Vision and Language Representation Learning with Momentum Distillation, NeurIPS 2021 Spotlight (Salesforce Research).

We adapted the code from: https://github.com/salesforce/ALBEF to run with VizWiz. To reproduce our results for VQA follow their instructions exactly. To reporduce our VizWiz results, use "vizwiz" instead. 

To evaluate the results, run "python vizwiz_eval.py" or "python vqa_eval.py", just adapting the path for the files.
