# VQA Accessibility
Code repo for our AACL paper "What’s Different between Visual Question Answering for Machine “Understanding” Versus for Accessibility?"

The code is split into two parts:

1. Our adaptations to the OpenVQA codebase (https://github.com/MILVLG/openvqa), which we update to work with VizWiz
2. Our adaptions to the ALBEF codebase (https://github.com/salesforce/ALBEF), which we update to work with VizWiz

Both folders also contain any new scripts that we wrote to do our analysis
